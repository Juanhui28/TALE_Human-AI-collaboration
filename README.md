# Human-AI Collaboration for Knowledge-in-use Assessment Design: Leveraging LLMs with RAG

This repository accompanies the IEEE TALE 2-25 paper:

**Human-AI Collaboration for Knowledge-in-use Assessment Design: Leveraging LLMs with RAG**  

## ðŸ“– Overview
This paper explores how **LLMs**, combined with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, can support the design of **knowledge-in-use assessment tasks**.  
We propose a **human-AI collaboration framework** where LLMs generate preliminary content following the Next Generation Science Assessment (NGSA) process, and human experts provide iterative feedback to refine the outputs.
